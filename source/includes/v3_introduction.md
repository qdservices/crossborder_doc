# Introduction

Welcome to the VDH Cross Border Ecommerce (CBE) tool API Documentation! 

The VDH CBE tool API allows you to perform cross border operations on the CBE system.

VDH Cross Border Ecommerce API is built using REST principles which ensures predictable URLs that makes writing applications easy. 
This API follows HTTP rules, enabling a wide range of HTTP clients which can be used to interact with the API.

Every resource is exposed as a URL. The URL of each resource can be obtained by accessing the API Root Endpoint [https://cbe.vdhelm.com/api/v3/](https://cbe.vdhelm.com/v3/).

For example the Waybills resource is reachable at [https://cbe.vdhelm.com/api/v3/waybills](https://cbe.vdhelm.com/v3/customers).

<aside class="notice">
  For testing API root URL <a href="https://staging.cbe.vdhelm.com/api/v3">https://staging.cbe.vdhelm.com/api/v3</a> is used. Your account representative will provide you with the account and key(s) for testing in the staging environment.
