# Introduction

Welcome to the <span style="font-weight: bold">ALL<span style="color: #d83636;">IN</span>E</span> Cross Border API Documentation! 

The <span style="font-weight: bold">ALL<span style="color: #d83636;">IN</span>E</span> Cross Border API allows you to perform cross border operations on the <span style="font-weight: bold">ALL<span style="color: #d83636;">IN</span>E</span> system.

<span style="font-weight: bold">ALL<span style="color: #d83636;">IN</span>E</span> Cross Border API is built using REST principles which ensures predictable URLs that makes writing applications easy. 
This API follows HTTP rules, enabling a wide range of HTTP clients which can be used to interact with the API.

Every resource is exposed as a URL. The URL of each resource can be obtained by accessing the API Root Endpoint [https://crossborder.omniship.eu/api/v3/](https://crossborder.omniship.eu/v3/).

For example the Waybills resource is reachable at [https://crossborder.omniship.eu/api/v3/waybills](https://crossborder.omniship.eu/v3/customers).

<aside class="notice">
  For testing the endpoint <a href="https://staging.crossborder.omniship.eu/api/v3">https://staging.crossborder.omniship.eu/api/v3</a> is used. Your account representative will provide you with the account and key(s) for testing in the staging environment.
