# Introduction

Welcome to the ALL<span style="color: #d83636;">IN</span>E Cross Border API Documentation! 

The ALL<span style="color: #d83636;">IN</span>E Cross Border API allows you to perform cross border operations on the OmniShip system.

ALL<span style="color: #d83636;">IN</span>E Cross Border API is built using REST principles which ensures predictable URLs that makes writing applications easy. 
This API follows HTTP rules, enabling a wide range of HTTP clients which can be used to interact with the API.

Every resource is exposed as a URL. The URL of each resource can be obtained by accessing the API Root Endpoint [https://crossborder.omniship.eu/api/v3/](https://crossborder.omniship.eu/v3/).

For example the Waybills resource is reachable at [https://crossborder.omniship.eu/api/v3/waybills](https://crossborder.omniship.eu/v3/customers).
